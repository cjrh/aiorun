    The trick here is that we add this coro to the global
    "DO_NOT_CANCEL" collection, and then later during the shutdown
    sequence we make sure that the task that wraps this coro will NOT
    be cancelled.

    To make this work, we have to create a super-secret task, below, that
    communicates with the caller (which "awaits" us) via a Future. Using
    a Future in this way allows us to avoid awaiting the Task, which
    decouples the Task from the normal exception propagation which would
    normally happen when the outer Task gets cancelled.  We get the
    result of coro back to the caller via Future.set_result.

    NOTE that during the shutdown sequence, the caller WILL NOT be able
    to receive a result, since the caller will likely have been
    cancelled.  So you should probably not rely on capturing results
    via this function.

        shutdown_waits_for) will be awaiting fut, NOT coro(), due to
        the decoupling. However, when coro completes, we need to send its
        result over to the fut to make it look *as if* it was just coro
        running the whole time. This whole thing is a teeny magic trick.

    # e.g.
    #
    # async def blah():
    #   x = await shutdown_waits_for(bleh())

    # That will work fine.  However, callers may *also* want to detach the
    # call from the current execution context, e.g.
    #
    # async def blah():
    #   loop.create_task(shutdown_waits_for(bleh()))
    #
    # This will only work if shutdown_waits_for() returns a coroutine.

    # return that.  Then both things will work.

    # if they used `asyncio.ensure_future()` instead, since that can work
    # with futures. But I don't like ensure_future.)

    # (Another side note: You don't even need `create_task()` or
    # `ensure_future()`...If you don't want a result, you can just call
    # `shutdown_waits_for()` as a flat function call, no await or anything,
